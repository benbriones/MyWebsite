  <p id="description"> My coding journey started at UC Berkeley (Go Bears!)
    where I graduated from in 2020. There I took some beginner classes in python and java and that’s
    really where my interest in software engineering began! After graduating, I
    was in Talent Acquisition at Afterpay and Square where I got to work with
    some pretty talented engineers! Seeing the impact they had on products that
    I used in my everyday life only piqued my interest even more in to becoming
    a software engineer. I’m super excited to be on this journey and can’t wait
    to see what the future holds!

  <p id="description"> On my free-time, I like to listen to music, log movies on
    my letterboxd, and play video games!</p>
